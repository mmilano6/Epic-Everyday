Epic Everyday immerses the user in a macroscopic sea of sound and visuals, allowing the user to inhabit the less than ordinary experience. The user will be able to engage with different channels throughout the experience. By inhabiting everyday objects, users can experience what is usually ignored thus challenging our preconceptions of what is important, and highlighting the oddity of inhabiting ignored spaces.

We are finding the sublime in the most ordinary of places. 

# // Context

Everyday, mundane objects are often overlooked. We don’t consider the experiential qualities of ubiquitous objects that are present in our daily lives. In Epic Everyday, virtual reality is utilized to transform how mundane objects are experienced. The installation presents video footage and the soundscape from a household environment. Once immersed in the virtual environment, the user experiences a heightened perspective of everyday objects through a dramatic shift in scale, and a magnified soundscape. Although this Epic Everyday is constructed as a computer simulation, we propose that this would be a real space in a person’s home, and that this content would be broadcasted like a webcam. These cameras would be placed with intent by voluntary users to capture ordinary experiences in a distinct way. By focusing on ordinary objects we can subvert what traditional film and tv have allowed viewers to do, escape from reality. Epic Everyday allows the viewer to escape their own reality by being further immersed in the everyday. The specific objects that we have chosen for the experiences are things that we interact with everyday. We disregard these objects and by highlighting their value in the Virtual Reality space we can create experiences that show how the mundane can be compelling.

# // Questions 

Can virtual reality be used to elevate a banal experience into something compelling?

Currently, VR is usually human-centric in regard to scale and point of view, but what happens 
when we shift this perspective to that of an object’s scale? 

What new soundscape do we become immersed in?

How does our understanding of a common household space change after this experience?

# // Inspirations 

The classic European tradition of still life paintings has commonly depicted everyday objects such as food or ceramics. These are objects that either signify material pleasures or reflect the the time and culture of the period. The still life has often been used for formal technical experiments in modern art.

4' 33"
John Cage
1952


4' 33" is a composition with no note written by John Cage, in which the a perfomer is silent. In the piece a performer enters the stage and doesn’t play an instrument for the entire piece. Cage illustrates that even in perceived silence, sound and noise are ubiquitous.

Can the traditionally passive view of a still life become something different in another medium? 

Virtual Reality affords the opportunity to be thoroughly immersed in new environments, this can be exploited to put a new lens on spaces that haven’t been previously experienced experienced. No longer is it necessary to passively view a painting, users can experience the still life as inhabiting the space. 

We adopted elements of Cage’s artistic intent and applied it to the still life in Virtual Reality. If we reduce our everyday experiences to the most mundane spaces can they reveal something that we haven’t previously considered? What is revealed when viewer’s focus is shifted from external consumption to internal discovery of banal spaces?


# // Process

I started this project with an interest in situating the viewer in a microscopic VR space. To me this is something that in the real world is rarely possible, but recently I had the chance to experience it, well sort of. I had just gotten back from visiting Death Valley National Park, which in many ways situates you in many vast spaces, and makes you realize your scale in the world. This micro/macro feeling was really interesting in this unique and extreme environment. Ths became a focus on wanted to explore in my piece, and seeing that the first part of the module was learning how to utilize photogrammetry to recreate an object into a 3d mesh with texture, I decided to find a way to scan an object in a way that allowed for that experience to occur. After a bit of experimenting I decided to work with a museum grade replica saber tooth cat skull that I have at home. (yes i have a museum grade replica saber tooth cat skull) 

I specifically wanted to utilize the inner jaw of the the skull as an environment for the user to be immersed in, while still allowing them to explore. This proved to be a much more difficult task than I first imagined it to be. Getting detailed images of the inside of the mouth was hard enough. There's only so much room between the jaws (I wanted them closed), and it’s way too small for a camera. This challenge is compounded by the fact that you cannot use lighting that creates shadows, or change the position of the object throughout taking photos. After several failed attempts I finally reached out to my girlfriend for help, (she has used photogrammetry in her work before) and was able to get a very nice scan.

Around this point I began working with Jason and Yeawon. We wanted to bring all three of our scans together to further explore this aspect of the microscopic user. We began using multiples of each of scans to create a spherical world that the user could explore, but more specifically one that allowed them to view each individual scan in a much larger detail than its original, and collectively as a surreal environment. This led to us questioning how we could really bring this heightened aspect of sense to the next level. After more exploration we landed on the idea of creating feeling stations, where the user could actively feel the tactile sensation of the general idea of several selected vantage points. Below is the experience we created
